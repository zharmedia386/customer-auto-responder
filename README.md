## Orientation

Corona Virus has affected business field a lot and it really harms for those small businesses, included
a business who are focusing on the food sales. It forces so many people to switch out their business into online.
It usually happends that the customer contacts the seller to ask about menu, price, shipping, and so on.

But, at that time, the seller can't be active for 24 hours to respond the customer's message. So, it'll basically affect the sales itself
cause if the seller can't give respond quickly, the customer might cancel the sales. So, it'll harm for the profit of that business especially if it happends not only once in a day.
